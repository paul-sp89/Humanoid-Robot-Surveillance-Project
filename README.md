Robotic System Project Overview:
Our robotic system is designed to provide real-time surveillance and monitoring capabilities. The system utilizes a USB camera for facial and object recognition, leveraging YOLO technology. In addition to its surveillance capabilities, the robot is equipped with mobility features, enabling it to move and interact with its environment.

Mobility System
The robot's mobility system consists of:

- Stepper Motors: High-precision stepper motors are used to control the robot's hand movements, providing accurate and reliable motion. The stepper motors are configured to work in tandem with the robot's control system, enabling smooth and precise hand gestures.
- DC Motors: High-torque DC motors are used to power the robot's movement, providing efficient and reliable locomotion. The DC motors are carefully calibrated to ensure smooth and stable movement.
- Meccanum Wheels: The robot is equipped with meccanum wheels, which provide omnidirectional movement capabilities. The meccanum wheels enable the robot to move in any direction, providing maximum flexibility and maneuverability.

Camera Configuration and Integration
I configured the USB camera and integrated it with the robot head using a Raspberry Pi 5, utilizing command-line interface for setup and control. The camera is configured for real-time video streaming and image capture, providing high-quality visual data for surveillance and monitoring applications.

Technical Details
- Camera: USB camera with YOLO-based facial and object recognition
- Processing Unit: Raspberry Pi 5
- Mobility System: Stepper motors, DC motors, and meccanum wheels
- Interface: Command-line interface (Linux)

Programming Languages:
